# GuessR
UoS Masters Dissertation Package
This package was created by Daniel Nash, as part of his MMath project for the award of his MMORSE (Masters of Maths, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics) degree. It aims to create a set of functions that allow for the creation and simulation of tests, allowing for analysis of test score distributions when test takers are required to 'guess'.
