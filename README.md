# GuessR
UoS Masters Dissertation Package
This Shiny application was created by Daniel Nash, as part of his MMath project for the award of his MMORSE (Masters of Maths, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics) degree. The functionality of the application relies largely on a package also created as a part of this project, titled GuessR. For question and comments, please contact me at  dn3g14@soton.ac.uk
