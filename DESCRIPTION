Description: The package allows users to create a custom test, being able to
    create tests with a desired amount of multiple choice questions with varying
    amounts of possible answers and marks available for each question. The user
    is then able to run a number of simulations of a person randomly guessing at
    the test, and produce various summary statistics and graphs from the results.
